                    <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>The Marciano brothers, who emigrated from the south of France to pursue the American dream, founded GUESS in 1981. The Marcianos revolutionized denim, drawing inspiration from European design. The 3-zip Marilyn, a slim-fitting, stonewashed jean, was one of their first creations. The first department shop to carry the brand was Bloomingdale, which placed an order for two dozen pairs of jeans. In a matter of hours, they vanished from the shelves. This was the start of an extended tale of triumph.</p>
                        <p>GUESS immediately came to represent a carefree, seductive, and daring way of life. Through its enduring and memorable advertising campaigns that elevated unknown faces to the status of famous models, GUESS has inspired people to dream throughout the years. The business expanded in 2004 when it unveiled a new store strategy for its Marciano contemporary collection. The Marciano brand offers a cutting-edge range made for stylish men and women. The Marciano brothers' own love of the youthful, California lifestyle they initially relished when they immigrated to America gave rise to the G by GUESS retail concept in 2007.</p>
