                    <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>May 1958 marks the start of the Pizza Hut saga. In Wichita, Kansas, Dan and Frank Carney opened a 550-square-foot pizzeria. Dan and Frank prepared the pizza together with their buddies John Bender and Richard Beemer. Frank used a rolling pin to roll out the dough. Richard threw the dough from the pie tin into the air. Dan poured sauce into the unbaked crust. When the pie was baking, John turned it out of the tin. Dan Carney recollected, "We threw the dough over our heads, and they were mesmerized by the outcome." They were having a great time.</p>
                        <p>The Carneys transformed a welcoming local diner into a creative, excellent, lively, and casual dining space. Pizza Hut gained popularity among young people and college students. Families who liked a night out and a supper they would not be having at home were drawn to Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut changed into a hangout for college-age kids when the families left. A vital component of Pizza Hut was having fun. The concept gained traction. In December 1958, a second Pizza Hut debuted in Wichita's downtown. There were 42 Pizza Hut locations in 1963.</p>
                        <p>Pizza Hut has always been a creative, inventive, and quick-thinking establishment. Everyone in the company communicated what they had learned. According to Frank Carney, Pizza Hut's greatest asset was the abundance of creative thinkers within our ranks.</p>
                        <p>Pizza Hut expanded quickly. In 1980, Pizza Hut launched Pan Pizza across its network. Made in deep pans, the product had a thicker crust that quickly gained popularity. Nonetheless, the customer's needs were and remain the primary internal philosophy. Today, the qualities of the Pizza Hut brand—charity, diligence, friendships, inventiveness, naturalness, and fun—resonate. More than just the pizza was and always will be the focus.</p>
