                    <h3>About</h3>
                        <P>Nando's is a chain of PERi-PERi chicken restaurants with a global presence. Robert Brozin and Fernando Duarte, two friends, launched the first Nando's restaurant in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1987. These original owners are still actively involved in Nando's care and administration. Dedicated to delivering the greatest taste chicken globally, Nando's restaurants are currently present on five continents. The Barcelos Cockerel, Nando's emblem, continues to be the most obvious representation of Nando's ardent interests.</P>
                        <P>Customers have become enthralled with Nando's real PERi-PERi. Nando keeps all of its PERi-PERi recipes a closely-guarded secret, including the wide variety of restaurant chicken-bastings, sauces, and spices. But Nando's chicken is what really brought the restaurant's fame. Customers select their chicken from a menu with full, half, or quarter butterfly-cut chicken, burgers, pitas, and salads. The chicken is flame-grilled rather than deep-fried. Next, they select the PERi-PERi flavor they want to try, which includes lemon and herb, spicy, extra hot, and mild. There are additional flavors available, such as Mozam Paprika and a kid-friendly option.</P>
